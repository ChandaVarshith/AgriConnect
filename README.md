#  AgriConnect

AgriConnect is a full-stack agricultural support platform designed to reduce the gap between farmers and essential resources such as expert guidance, weather insights, and community knowledge.

AgriConnect is a four-role full-stack dashboard platform enabling Farmers, Experts/Admins, Financiers, and Public users to collaborate in agriculture.

This repository currently contains the **initial frontend setup** and a **minimal backend starter**, and is under active development.


## Project Goals
